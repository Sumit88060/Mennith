    loveLetter: `Menn ❤️

I was gonna write something calm…
but you already know I’m down bad for you 😭💖

You’re my favorite person,
my peace, my chaos, my happiness… all in one.

Life just feels better with you in it.
Like everything makes more sense when it’s you.

And yeah… I act funny and all,
but I really, really love you. 😌❤️

So no escaping me now 💅

— Yours (forever) ❤️`,
