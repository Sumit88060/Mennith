To my little princess ❤️

You have a heart too good for this awful world,  
but that’s okay because I promise to always protect your soft, fragile heart.

I just wish you could see how beautiful, pretty, and truly deserving your kind soul is.  
I love how passionate you are in everything you do,  
and how you always stand up for those who are afraid to speak up.

My precious girl, watching you smile has never once failed to make me smile,  
because you are my joy, my happiness, and my peace.

Even in my wildest imagination, I never thought someone like you could exist   
someone so cute, with the prettiest face, and everything about you just feels perfect to me.  
If there was such a thing as perfection, it would be you, my sweet baby.

I am so proud of you, and I know you will shine so brightly  
as we live the rest of our lives together.

And my love… I admire your strength more than anything.  
You’ve been through so much, yet you still keep going,  
still trying your best every single day, still facing everything with courage.  
That strength, that endurance… it’s beautiful, and I admire you so much for it.  
You truly deserve the whole world.

I know I haven’t always been the best boyfriend.  
I haven’t always understood you, and we’ve fought many times.  
Sometimes I wish I could have done more, been better for you.

But I promise you this…  
I will keep trying, I will keep improving,  
and I will give you all the love and happiness you deserve.

Just like I promised you on our first night,  
I will make you happy.

I love you with all my heart.  
Always & forever ❤️
